_Hello!_
Hey My name is **Aman Kumar** and I'm from the **Computer Science & Engineering** Department. I hail from **Bokaro Steel City,Jharkhand**. I enjoy _listening to music_,_learning new things_ and _reading books_. I can speak **Hindi** & **English**.
As far as my _coding experience_ is concerned, I m a **noob** by the way.
I have learnt **C** language after i entered my college, before that i had no exposure to coding environment. Learning **C** from scratch was a bit _challenging but very interesting_. Other than **C**, I know little bit of **C++**.
I always give a try to every new language i listen about and would like to mention that I have tried my hands at **Java** and **Python** too.
I somehow know **HTML** and **JavaScript**.
My First Year at NITT was spent as a _memoir_ of learning experience because I have tried my hands on _lots of stuffs_.
Now, I have applied for **Spider** _Inductions_ and hope to get inducted into the team. Even if I fail, I'll drive home lots of new stuffs that I'll learn throughout this process.
_Thank you_!
